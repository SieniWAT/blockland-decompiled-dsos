# Blockland Retail Beta Verison 7 DSO Decompilation

This was done with my fork of dso.js that uses opcodes provided by the person working on the ThinkTanks DSO decompiler.
You may notice that some functions have a null argument. This is likely an issue with the decompiler that I haven't solved. These null arguments aren't actually used in the functions and don't affect functionality, but it's still on the radar to fix.
