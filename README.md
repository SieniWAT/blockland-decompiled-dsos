# Blockland v1 Retail DSO Decompilation

This was done with my fork of dso.js that includes v1 opcodes.
You may notice that some functions have a null argument. This is likely an issue with the decompiler that I haven't solved. These null arguments aren't actually used in the functions and don't affect functionality, but it's still on the radar to fix.
These DSOs have been tested in game and functionality seems to work properly.
